## Brief 2-3 line introduction about why Cassandra and Alpakka could be interesting to users. Maybe mention a typical use case of that. (e.g.) You had to use Cassandra for scaling, and use 

## What Cassandra is, and why it matters the in stream processing context

- Assume readers would are somewhat familiar with Cassandra, so don’t go into too much detail about Cassandra itself
- Maybe the reader already has akka-based backend systems, which you want to connect Cassandra to, in a streaming fasion

## What Alpakka is

- Community-based effort
- Implements EIP patterns with streams

## CassandraSource example

- Animation
- Code snippet
- Typical cases where this is useful
- Describe how it improves, compared to simply using cassandra query

## CasandraFlow example

- Same 4 points as CassandraSource

## CassandraSink example

- Same 4 points as CassandraSource

## Integration with akka-persistence-cassandra??
- Not sure if it even makes sense. it’s homework for me to investigate, or if the akka team knows about this, even if it does not work, please let me know
